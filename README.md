This is PRODIGY_DS_01 task. The task was to take any dataset of our choice or the dataset that the question has it itself, and derive bar charts or histograms based on the distributions it makes on any categorical or continous variable it holds.
So I took the data of Sample Superstore in tableau itself and in that I have made a bar chart showing the sales of products like office supplies and technology over the last 3 years.
Clearly, the barchart distribution shows that the technology products section has gained alot of profits as its sales are at the top notch in all the 3 years from 2022 to 2024 compared to office supplies.
So we can conclude that office supplies are bought and used by older aged people, hence they find their stuff good enough until they find it difficult to use it and thus proceeds to buy newer products.
Whereas on the other hand, technology products are of higher value in this generation where both elder and younger people purchase it, making it the most profitable section.
